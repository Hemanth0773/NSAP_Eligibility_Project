# NSAP Eligibility Prediction

This project uses a machine learning model to predict eligibility for the **National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP)** based on various socio-economic factors. The dataset was sourced from [AI Kosh]([https://vikalp.ai/datasets](https://aikosh.indiaai.gov.in/web/datasets/details/district_wise_pension_data_under_the_national_social_assistance_programme_nsap_1.html)), and the goal is to assist with targeted beneficiary identification.

## 📁 Files Included

- `NSAP_Eligibility_Prediction.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook with data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `dataset.csv` – Dataset used for training the model.
- `nsap_model.pkl`: Trained machine learning model.
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation.

## 🚀 Objectives

- Understand the problem of identifying NSAP eligibility.
- Explore and clean the data.
- Apply suitable machine learning models.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and classification report.
- Make predictions to assist in eligibility screening.

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Model Overview

The notebook walks through:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preprocessing steps (handling null values, encoding, etc.)
- Splitting the dataset
- Training and evaluating models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.

## ✅ Results

The model achieves good accuracy on test data and is suitable for aiding in eligibility screening. Further improvements can be made with hyperparameter tuning or deep learning.
